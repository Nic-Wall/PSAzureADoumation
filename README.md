# PSAzureADoumation
Scripts used to automate Azure AD processes. Small to large or just making life easier one custom extension property at a time. (No guarantee they will work as intended. Many were written as I was learning PowerShell and are not written efficiently.)
AzureGroupandTheirUsers, dellLaptopExpirationAudit, forTesting, managerAuditT1, O365Adit, and readyToDeleteTest were written as I was learning Powershell. As such I these may not work as intended and may appear inefficient and beginner level (because they are).
Any of the other scripts were written at least a year after these and I would consider complete. Once again, no guarentee is offered as to how they run on your system or in you administration.
I am mostly uploading these as public so future employers can see I have at least some experience and am constantly learning. Thanks for stopping by and feel free to send tips if you have any!
